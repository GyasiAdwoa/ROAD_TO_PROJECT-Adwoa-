 Project 1 Monthly Scheme Loan Repayment Schedule for Public Institutions:

Goal: To create a structured repayment schedule for loans under the Monthly Scheme for Public Institution.
Data Sources: Obtain data on loan amounts, interest rates, repayment terms, and borrower information from relevant databases or records.
Methods: Use spreadsheet software or specialized loan amortization tools to calculate monthly repayments, interest payments, and remaining balances based on loan parameters.

Project  2  Develop manual standing order settings to handle credit card defaulters whose direct debit payments were not successful.
Data Sources: Collect data on credit card accounts, payment history, default status, and payment preferences from banking systems or transaction records.
Methods: Implement a manual standing order system that allows credit card defaulters to set up alternative payment methods or schedules to clear their dues.
Expected Outcomes: Reduced default rates, improved customer payment experiences, and better management of credit card delinquencies.

Project 3 Amortization Schedule for Classified Loans

 Create an amortization schedule for loans that have been classified, possibly based on risk categories or delinquency levels.
Data Sources: Gather data on classified loans, loan terms, repayment histories, and risk assessments from financial institutions' loan management systems.
Methods: Utilize financial modeling techniques and software tools to generate amortization schedules tailored to different loan classifications, incorporating factors like interest rates and payment frequencies.
Expected Outcomes: Detailed amortization schedules that facilitate monitoring and management of classified loans, aiding in risk analysis and decision-making processes.
